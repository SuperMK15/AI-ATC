# ATC.AI

Welcome to ATC.AI! This web application allows you to practice your ATC communication in a quick and easy manner, by leveraging the power of LLMs!

The application supports full speech transcription through your microphone, then passes it to the LLM AI model. The model then generates a response appropriate to the provided situation, and the application uses a TTS library to respond to you, as if you are talking to ATC in real time!
